This folder contains the Assignment Question along with the codes and necessary documentation for the Lab on the Memory Management in xv6 OS.

## Execution Instructions:

1) Integrate the modified files with a fresh copy xv6 source code. (Can be taken from xv6-public.tgz file)
2) Run the "make" command to compile the source code, and then run "make qemu" (or "make qemu-nox" depending on the Host OS) to build xv6 and run it on the simulator.

## For Part B only

Since Part B has testcases with outputs, so they can be run seperately after compiling the xv6 OS. After running the given testcases, they can be compared with the expected outputs.

### Note:
To run testcase0.c, the command is "testcase0", and like-wise the other two test case files. (Make sure these commands are run in the emulator)
